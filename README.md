## 📌 Troubleshooting
If you encounter errors during installation or while running the application, try the following steps:
- Ensure you have **Node.js (v16 or later)** installed.
- If `npm install` fails, delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` and run `npm install` again:
  ```sh
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
  npm install
  ```
- If you see `EPERM: operation not permitted` errors, try running the commands with administrator privileges.
- Restart the development server if changes are not reflected immediately.

## 📝 Additional Notes

- Data is fetched from an API using the `fetch` function inside `useEffect`.
- Ensure your internet connection is active while fetching product data.
